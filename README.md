# Philosophers

## Key Concepts Learned
- **Multithreading**: Managing multiple threads simultaneously for philosopher actions.
- **Mutexes**: Using mutexes to prevent race conditions and ensure synchronization.
- **Deadlock Avoidance**: Implementing strategies to avoid deadlocks, where philosophers can't eat.
- **Starvation Prevention**: Ensuring no philosopher waits too long without eating.
- **Resource Management**: Efficiently managing shared resources (forks) among philosophers.
  
## Project Overview
The **Philosophers** project is a classic synchronization problem where several philosophers sit at a table with forks between them. Each philosopher alternates between thinking, eating, and sleeping. The challenge is to ensure that the philosophers don't encounter deadlocks (unable to eat) and starvation (waiting too long to eat).

## Features
- Implements a solution to the dining philosophers problem using multithreading.
- Ensures synchronization with mutexes to avoid race conditions.
- Handles edge cases like deadlocks and starvation.

## How to Build
Use the `Makefile` to compile the program:

```bash
make
```

This will generate an executable named `philo`.

## How to Run
To execute the program, use the following command:

```bash
./philo <number_of_philosophers> <time_to_die> <time_to_eat> <time_to_sleep> [optional: number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
```

- **number_of_philosophers**: The number of philosophers (and forks).
- **time_to_die**: Time (in ms) before a philosopher dies without eating.
- **time_to_eat**: Time (in ms) a philosopher spends eating.
- **time_to_sleep**: Time (in ms) a philosopher spends sleeping.
- **number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat** (optional): Minimum times each philosopher must eat.

### Example:
```bash
./philo 5 800 200 200
```

## Key Files
- **main.c**: The main entry point of the program.
- **philo_thread.c**: Manages philosopher behavior through threads.
- **mutex.c**: Handles mutexes to prevent race conditions.
- **time.c**: Time tracking for the simulation.
- **Makefile**: Builds the project.

## Important Considerations
- Be mindful of deadlocks and starvation issues.
- Ensure that mutexes are correctly implemented for synchronization.
